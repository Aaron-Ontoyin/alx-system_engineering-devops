1. A server is a computer or system that provides services or resources to other computers or clients over a network. It can refer to both the hardware and software components responsible for handling requests and delivering data or functionality to clients.

2. The role of a domain name is to provide a human-readable and memorable address for websites or services hosted on the internet. It serves as a unique identifier for a specific location or organization on the web. Domain names are used in URLs to access websites and facilitate the translation of human-readable names into IP addresses that computers understand.

3. The DNS record for "www" in the domain name "www.foobar.com" is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It is used to point the "www" subdomain to the main domain or another hostname.

4. The role of a web server is to handle and respond to HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) by delivering web pages or other resources. It takes advantage of the application server to deliver dynamic content.

5. An application server is responsible for executing applications and providing services and resources to support the functioning of those applications. It can handle business logic, manage transactions, handle security, and provide various services to clients or other servers. Application servers often work in conjunction with web servers to deliver dynamic web applications.

6. The role of a database is to store, manage, and organize large volumes of structured data in this case(MySQL). It provides an efficient and reliable way to store and retrieve information for applications. Databases can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as storing user data, product catalogs, financial records, and more.

7. The server uses the internet protocol (IP) to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website. Specifically, it uses the HTTP protocol to transmit data over the internet to the user's computer. The server sends the requested web page or resources in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, or other data that the browser can interpret and display.

Issues with the mentioned infrastructure:

- SPOF (Single Point of Failure): If there is a single point of failure in the infrastructure, such as a critical server or component that, if it fails, can bring down the entire system, it poses a risk. If this component fails, it can lead to service disruption or complete outage until the issue is resolved.

- Downtime during maintenance: When maintenance activities like deploying new code or restarting the web server are required, it may result in downtime or service interruption. During this period, the website or service may be temporarily inaccessible to users, causing inconvenience or loss of business.

- Scalability limitations: If the infrastructure cannot scale effectively to handle increased incoming traffic, it can lead to performance degradation or service disruption during peak usage periods. The system should have provisions for scaling horizontally (adding more servers) or vertically (increasing resources of existing servers) to accommodate growing demand.
